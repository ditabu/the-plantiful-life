# App Title: The Plantiful Life

I am a Plantista. I want to help build a community with other Plantistas who share a common interest in plants. Like having a pet, plants helped many get through this pandemic, be it in health and wellness, having a companion, or having something to nourish and watch grow. 

The Plantiful Life is a full stack web application developed with a simple user friendly experience in mind. It is clean and lightweight with a primary focus on tracking your plant's growth and maintenance. You have the capability to add info about your plant in a list to store in one location, as well as track the date and time you watered and groomed your plant in a care log. You can also check out other Plantista's collections and care logs to compare with yours.
